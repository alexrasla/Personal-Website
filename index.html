									<h2>Bionic Vision VR Simulation</h2>
									<p> For my computer science masters research project, I studied the effectiveness of combining different deep-learning based computer vision techniques to highlight more meaningful information when using retinal prostheses – devices used to treat degenerative eye diseases. 
										These devices rely on an external camera to capture the visual scene, which is then translated frame-by-frame into an electrical stimulation pattern that is sent to the implant in the eye. 
										To test the effectiveness of the combination of different simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) modes such as room layout estimation and relative depth extraction, we presented the modes individually (DepthOnly, LayoutOnly), together (DepthAndLayout), 
										and by giving the user the ability to flexibly switch between them (DepthOrLayout). We used SPV in a virtual reality environment to test the effectiveness of the different modes by tasking users with avoiding obstacles and recognizing objects. 
										This study is an important first step towards a retinal prosthesis that uses computer vision to improve a user’s scene understanding.

									<p>While working at HRL, I developed a convolutional LSTM autoencoder from scratch to detect novel scenarios for an autonomous driving system.<span id="dotsHRL">..</span> <span id="moreHRL" style="display:none;">I was 
										in complete control of the novelty detection project – the ideas to try based on my literature reviews, the implementation of the system, and how to evaluate its effectiveness – but the detection system was part of a larger, industrial scale autonomous driving system. 
										In order to build this system, I tuned the individual parameter layers of an autoencoder and a created custom loss function in Tensorflow to optimize its reliability and stability. 
										To test the stability and functionality of the model I had trained, I ran dozens of real world scenarios using CARLA simulation tests. This allowed me to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the system with the 
										other componenets of the system, and improve my novelty detection system accordingly.
										Further, once the model was complete, I had to be able to detect the novel scenarios in real time and signal the remaining parts of the system to respond accordingly.

									<h3>A brief look. </h3>
									<p> Hey! If you haven't alredy guessed, my name is Alex
										Rasla. I am currently a senior in the process of earning a 5 years bachelors degree and masters degree in Computer
										Science from the
										Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara. I grew up in Irvine, California alongside my older
										brother Andrew and my younger sister Olivia.
										As a child, I had an obsession with computers and technology. I jailbroke and tweaked
										iPhones, researched how to fix my own
										technological issues, and had a itch to learn about the underlying mechanisms of these
										limitless machines.
										Throughout my life, I always had a creative instinct — whether it was building structures
										and cars from Legos as a child, or
										adding my own fill while playing Elton John songs today. Coupled with my facination with
										computers, this combination flourished into
										and educational pursuit of learning about computers and software development.</p>

														<p>When my parents were in their early twenties, they decided to try to escape the communist Slovak regime and immigrate to America. After spending over a year at an Austrian refugee camp, they finally became eligable and landed in Houston, Texas. There, they each got degrees from the Univeristy of Houston. A year after I was born in 1999, my parents moved to California where my father started his own private practice as an attourney, and my mother worked for an accounting firm. Today, my father still has his practice and my mother teaches yoga at a local studio.

															I was raised in a home where homework had to be finished before playing outside, family dinners were a mandatory, nightly routine, and electronics had to be off by 11pm. As a family, we spent alot of time together -- whether it was planning a family outing, going out to dinner, or watching a movie together before bed. My siblings and I were given alot of freedom to explore our own interests academically and socially, but were also under a strict set of rules that bared consequences if we stepped out of line. My parents cared for us deeply and did everything they could to provide opportunities for us. They taught us to speak Slovak to be able to connect to our native culture, made us play sports to keep us phycsially active and stay out of trouble, and took us around the world for us us to gain perspective and humility.
