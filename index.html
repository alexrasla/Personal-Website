									<h3>A brief look. </h3>
									<p> Hey! If you haven't alredy guessed, my name is Alex
										Rasla. I am currently a senior in the process of earning a 5 years bachelors degree and masters degree in Computer
										Science from the
										Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara. I grew up in Irvine, California alongside my older
										brother Andrew and my younger sister Olivia.
										As a child, I had an obsession with computers and technology. I jailbroke and tweaked
										iPhones, researched how to fix my own
										technological issues, and had a itch to learn about the underlying mechanisms of these
										limitless machines.
										Throughout my life, I always had a creative instinct â€” whether it was building structures
										and cars from Legos as a child, or
										adding my own fill while playing Elton John songs today. Coupled with my facination with
										computers, this combination flourished into
										and educational pursuit of learning about computers and software development.</p>

														<p>When my parents were in their early twenties, they decided to try to escape the communist Slovak regime and immigrate to America. After spending over a year at an Austrian refugee camp, they finally became eligable and landed in Houston, Texas. There, they each got degrees from the Univeristy of Houston. A year after I was born in 1999, my parents moved to California where my father started his own private practice as an attourney, and my mother worked for an accounting firm. Today, my father still has his practice and my mother teaches yoga at a local studio.

															I was raised in a home where homework had to be finished before playing outside, family dinners were a mandatory, nightly routine, and electronics had to be off by 11pm. As a family, we spent alot of time together -- whether it was planning a family outing, going out to dinner, or watching a movie together before bed. My siblings and I were given alot of freedom to explore our own interests academically and socially, but were also under a strict set of rules that bared consequences if we stepped out of line. My parents cared for us deeply and did everything they could to provide opportunities for us. They taught us to speak Slovak to be able to connect to our native culture, made us play sports to keep us phycsially active and stay out of trouble, and took us around the world for us us to gain perspective and humility.

										Vista community and visualize the best route to take. The iOS app provides users an interactive map
										that allows the user to pick a destination, choose either a 2D or augmented reality view, and seamlessly
										shows directions to the destination through guiding lines.

I worked with massive data bases filled with a variety of customer information and developed filters and styling on the website to return the correct information for the staff to analyze.
									 	At Wimet, I was exposed to HTML for the first time, meaning I had to learn everything about it -- in Spanish. Once I felt comfortable enough with HTML, I was inspired to make this website.

									<h3> NAVCO Security </h3>
									<p> At NAVCO Security, I was exposed to my first job involving computers and software.<span id="dotsNavco">..</span><span id="moreNavco" style="display:none;"> My main task at NAVCO was 
										to work on updating and reprogramming the hard drives for Wells Fargo's security system. I reprogrammed about
										200 hard drives for the company that were shipped out in increments to different locations around the world. 
										Furthermore, I was also tasked with restoring and deleting information on hard drives that were outdated or not needed anymore.
										Eventually, I started working on broken and disfunctional DVR and camera equipment and hard drives that customers sent in to be repaired. I would analyze 
										whether theses devices were salvagable, and if so, renew some of their parts and restore them using Putty.
